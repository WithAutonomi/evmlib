## Pull requests: fill the template

When you open a pull request, you MUST use `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` as
the PR body and fill it in completely — do not open a PR with an empty or ad-hoc
description.

- **Fill every field.** Leave nothing blank; if a value isn't determinable, ask
  before opening the PR.
- **Link the Linear issue** — an issue key like `V2-123` or a `linear.app` URL.
  CI blocks PRs with no linked Linear issue.
- **Check exactly one Risk tier box and exactly one Semver impact box.** Propose
  them from the change; a human confirms them at review.
- An **ADR link is required for Tier 2/3**.

CI enforces the Linear link and the template fields (`linear-link` and
`pr-template` status checks); a PR that omits them fails its checks.
